NUCLEUS - New understanding of the Conditions for Life Based Experiments up in  Space, The Biosatellite Program

Nucleus satellite program aims at making IIT Guwahati the first institute from Northeast India to have a dedicated space program and to aid its future space needs. This program is divided in specific phases namely: - 

HABSAT: The 1st phase consists of a balloon satellite which aims to understand the behaviour of certain microbes in the lower stratosphere( approx. 20-30 kms above ground level). 
 

Lower earth orbit(LEO) Cubesat:- As the name suggests, after the success of phase 1, the next aim is to send a bio satellite in the lower earth orbit to study the behaviour of microbes in the upper atmosphere( A.K.A the lower earth orbit). 

Further phases will be unveiled after the completion of first 2 phases.
