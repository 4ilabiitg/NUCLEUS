NUCLEUS - New understanding of the Conditions for Life Based Experiments up in  Space, The Biosatellite Program

Nucleus satellite program aims at making IIT Guwahati the first institute from Northeast India to have a dedicated space program and to aid its future space needs. This program is divided in specific phases namely: - 

HABSAT: The 1st phase consists of a balloon satellite which aims to understand the behaviour of certain microbes in the lower stratosphere( approx. 20-30 kms above ground level). 
 

Lower earth orbit(LEO) Cubesat:- As the name suggests, after the success of phase 1, the next aim is to send a bio satellite in the lower earth orbit to study the behaviour of microbes in the upper atmosphere( A.K.A the lower earth orbit). 

Further phases will be unveiled after the completion of first 2 phases. 

# Progress till now 
The first phase of Nucleus BIOSAT program will be the HABSAT project.
Team Microbiology:-
Upto now, the HABSAT project has been finalized in which certain motile and non-motile organisms will be exposed to the upper stratosphere condition to monitor the changes in them due to altitude, low level radiations. These results will be compared with  lab conditions and the interpretations will be published.

Team Electrical/Mechanical and Thermal:-
Sensors required to measure the altitude, Radiation level, temperature, pressure and other parameters have been identified and will be assembled to form a radiosonde, which will do the work of transmitting those reading to the ground station.

Further phases:-
Budget compilation is in progress, and the assembling process will start as soon as the team gathers together after the pandemic break.
