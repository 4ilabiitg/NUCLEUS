The first phase of Nucleus BIOSAT program will be the HABSAT project.
Team Microbiology:-
Upto now, the HABSAT project has been finalized in which certain motile and non-motile organisms will be exposed to the upper stratosphere condition to monitor the changes in them due to altitude, low level radiations. These results will be compared with  lab conditions and the interpretations will be published.

Team Electrical/Mechanical and Thermal:-
Sensors required to measure the altitude, Radiation level, temperature, pressure and other parameters have been identified and will be assembled to form a radiosonde, which will do the work of transmitting those reading to the ground station.

Further phases:-
Budget compilation is in progress, and the assembling process will start as soon as the team gathers together after the pandemic break.
